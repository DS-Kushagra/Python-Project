# Python-Project

In the 1st Step, I have imported all the necessary libraries for structuring data and visualization.

And after importing libraries, I created various categories on which the analysis has to be done and added logic in it. 

After that, I have createda DataFrame to make the understandibility of the data more easier and the visualization simpler.
Like:-
1.Displayed the first few rows of the dataset.
2.Summarised statistics.
3.Have checked for missing values.
4.Done Distribution of categori.es
5.Set the style for seaborn.

After all this important stuffs, I then started to plot the data in various types:-
1.Plotted Bar for the distribution of categories.
2.Done Box plotting to show the distribution of likes in different categories.
3.Shown Histogram of likes.
4.Done Violin plot to show the density of likes across categories

Then I Calculated the mean likes for each category,Identified the category with the highest mean likes.

At the end I printed the Summary of findings for everyone to undersatand all the data and it's output easily.
